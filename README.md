# **Rock, Paper, Scissors**

## Introduction:
My site is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game but a variation that includes ZOMBIES!  This was a project assigned by the Turing School of Software and Design’s Front-End program.

## Set Up
Locally, create a new folder containing an empty index.html file, a blank scripts.js file, and an empty styles.css file.
Run git init in your terminal (make sure your working directory is your project folder).
Create an initial commit.
On GitHub, create a new repository. Follow the written instructions on GitHub to add the repo’s remote to your local project, and push your initial commit up to GitHub.
Add all project partners to the repository as contributors.
If your repository is set to private, add your project manager as a collaborator as well.

## Technologies:
HTML
CSS
Javascript

## Functions:
When the page is initially opened, the user will have the option to choose Classic or Difficult.  Depending on the game type, a set of icons will appear for the user to choose their weapon.  The computer (Zombie) will generate a random icon and then the battle begins!  Additionally, you are able to choose a different game during play.  Be mindful of your choices - you are safe until the zombies attack!

## Possible Future Extensions:
Give the user the ability to lock and unlock a particular color.
In the future, we would love to get through the offered extensions.
